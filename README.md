# Searching for information

## Places to find information

- [Google](https://www.google.com/) Let's be honest, you can find almost anything by Googling it.

- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/) The r/smashbros subreddit can be a treasure trove of resources, albeit sometimes filled with useless posts. The sidebar and wiki are where the good information usually is.
- [SmashWiki](https://www.ssbwiki.com/) The go-to place for any information about the game itself or about the known players.

- [USB 3.0 to Ethernet Adapter for your Switch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MYTSN18/) If you are planning on playing online, please consider using a LAN adapter for the best and most stable connection possible. No, your Wi-Fi is not better than LAN.

## Advanced

- ["SmashConceptions: Understanding Neutral" by Vermanubis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8EIRu-Vwak) A brief overview of what the neutral game actually refers to. I recommend watching this before moving on to something more in-depth like Nuances of Neutral.

- ["SmashConceptions: Autopiloting" by Vermanubis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8K6WVAAjiU) One thing that tends to hold a lot of players back is their tendency to start autopiloting, AKA playing without thinking/concentrating. This video talks about that.

- ["The Importance of Spacing and Moving" by Zephyr](https://ssbworld.com/blog/36/cloud-spacing) One badly-spaced move is all it takes to be on the rough end of a 60% combo, so it's good to learn how to space properly.
